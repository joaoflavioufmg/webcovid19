Consider a compartmental model21,22 in which the population is divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals. A rate of β of S individuals in contact with I (S-I contact) becomes E and progress in the course of the incubation period in a rate σ to state I. While a rate γ of I recover from the disease, a rate of I evolves to death. A fraction ξ of R recovered individuals may become (or not, if ξ = 0) re-susceptible (S), therefore, an SEIRS model. The effect of testing a segment of the population is modeled by introducing the rate of transmission for individuals with detected infections (\beta_D), detected exposed (D_E), and detected infectious (D_I) states. Let \psi_E and \psi_I be the probability of positive tests for exposed and infected individuals, and Q, the rate of individuals with detected infection interacting with the population. Then D_E and D_I results from \theta_E\psi_E and \theta_I\psi_I rates of testing exposed E and infected I individuals, respectively. The model describes the full spectrum of disease. Let N be the estimate of an affected population, thus, N=S+E+I+D_E+D_I+R.
