Consider a compartmental model21,22 in which the population is divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals. A rate of β of S individuals in contact with I (S-I contact) becomes E and progress in the course of the incubation period in a rate σ to state I. While a rate γ of I recover from the disease, a rate of I evolves to death. A fraction ξ of R recovered individuals may become (or not, if ξ = 0) re-susceptible (S), therefore, an SEIRS model. The effect of testing a segment of the population is modeled by introducing the rate of transmission for individuals with detected infections (β<sub>D</sub>), detected exposed (D<sub>E</sub>), and detected infectious (D<sub>I</sub>) states. Let ψ<sub>E</sub> and ψ<sub>I</sub> be the probability of positive tests for exposed and infected individuals, and Q, the rate of individuals with detected infection interacting with the population. Then D<sub>E</sub> and D<sub>I</sub> results from θ<sub>E</sub>ψ<sub>E</sub> and θ<sub>I</sub>ψ<sub>I</sub> rates of testing exposed E and infected I individuals, respectively. The model describes the full spectrum of disease. Let N be the estimate of an affected population, thus, N=S+E+I+D_E+D_I+R. Let F be the number of infected-related fatalities. The model states are obtained by equations (1)-(7) and the model dynamics is illustrated in Figure 1.
