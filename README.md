Consider a compartmental model21,22 in which the population is divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals. A rate of β of S individuals in contact with I (S-I contact) becomes E and progress in the course of the incubation period in a rate σ to state I. While a rate γ of I recover from the disease, a rate of I evolves to death. A fraction ξ of R recovered individuals may become (or not, if ξ = 0) re-susceptible (S), therefore, an SEIRS model. The effect of testing a segment of the population is modeled by introducing the rate of transmission for individuals with detected infections (β<sub>D</sub>), detected exposed (D<sub>E</sub>), and detected infectious (D<sub>I</sub>) states. Let ψ<sub>E</sub> and ψ<sub>I</sub> be the probability of positive tests for exposed and infected individuals, and Q, the rate of individuals with detected infection interacting with the population. Then D<sub>E</sub> and D<sub>I</sub> results from θ<sub>E</sub>ψ<sub>E</sub> and θ<sub>I</sub>ψ<sub>I</sub> rates of testing exposed E and infected I individuals, respectively. The model describes the full spectrum of disease. Let N be the estimate of an affected population, thus, N=S+E+I+D_E+D_I+R. Let F be the number of infected-related fatalities. The model states are obtained by equations (1)-(7) and the model dynamics is illustrated in Figure 1.

To represent the ICU and clinical beds’ dynamics, consider that a fraction of infected individuals is asymptomatic (I<sub>A</sub>). The rate α for symptomatic cases (I<sub>S</sub>=I-I<sub>A</sub>) requiring hospitalization (H) is \alpha I<sub>S</sub>. Let T be the number of planning days during the pandemic with t corresponding to each admission day on the hospital. For clinical bed dynamics, consider L<sub>s</sub> and L<sub>f</sub> as the average length of stay (LoS) of surviving patients,  and the patients that passed away, respectively. For surviving patients on ICU beds, the average length of stay is L<sub>b</sub>+L<sub>d</sub>+L<sub>a</sub>, where L<sub>b</sub> represents the surviving patients of clinical beds re-directed to ICU beds, L<sub>d</sub> is the average LoS of surviving patients in ICU beds, and L<sub>a</sub>, as the average LoS in clinical beds of surviving patients after being re-directed from ICU beds. For deceased victims on ICU bed dynamics, the average LoS is L<sub>c</sub>+L<sub>i</sub>, representing the average period a deceased patient will stay in clinical and ICU beds, respectively. Given the average length of stay metrics for ICU and clinical dynamics, we calculate admission and leave days for each patient profile. For a surviving clinical patient, whose admission day is t, the expected day that the patient leaves the clinical bed is T<sub>o</sub>=t+L<sub>s</sub>–1. A clinical patient that progressed to death is expected to be removed from the hospital in T<sub>f</sub>=t+L<sub>f</sub>-1. A surviving ICU patient is admitted in T<sub>i</sub>=t+L<sub>b</sub>. In T<sub>r</sub>=T<sub>i</sub>+L<sub>d</sub>, the patient return to the clinical bed, and in T<sub>c</sub>=T<sub>r</sub>+L<sub>a</sub>-1, the patient leaves the clinical bed. For a deceased ICU patient, the admission day is T<sub>d</sub>=t+L<sub>c</sub> , and T<sub>u</sub>=T<sub>d</sub>+L<sub>i</sub>-1 is the expected day that the patient is removed from the hospital. Let H<sub>t</sub> be the daily admission of patients in hospitals, and τ the fraction of hospitalized cases that require critical care in ICU. Also, consider ζ and η the rates of critical patients that evolve to death on ICU beds and clinical beds, respectively. Therefore, the daily use of ICU beds and clinical beds, represented by U<sub>tICU</sub> and U<sub>tC</sub>, is obtained by the equations (8).
